## Ylide Protocol

Ylide Protocol is a cross-chain wallet-to-wallet communications solution for Web3 projects.

It consists of four main parts:

### Client SDK

Ylide Client SDK is a "just-add-water" solution for integrating decentralised end-to-end encrypted communications right into your existing or new application. Right now <a href="https://github.com/ylide-io/sdk">we provide</a> Ylide Client SDK in TypeScript (JavaScript).

### Prebuilt smart contacts

It's a core of our product. Smart contracts used for storing, transferring and managing messages on the blockchain. Contracts pre-deployed by Ylide can be used and seamlessly integrated. Or founders can create a customised solution on the top of it.

We will provide contracts for multiple mainstream blockchains with cross-chain facilitation. Right now, dedicated solution for EverScale <a href="https://github.com/ylide-io/everscale-contracts">is here</a>.

### Admin Tools

It is a solution to forget about coding at all. Deploy, monitor, manage smart contracts and set custom monetisation parameters of your choice from the handy UI.

### Pre-build products.

To save even more time of the founders we provide open-source product templates for typical communication use cases, so you can focus on the customisation and skip the hardest part.
